Intent and narrative of the game: 

We designed our game with the enjoyment of the user in mind. Each sprite is adorably cute, and the user can’t help but smile while playing. While there is no clear explanation for why the astronaut is on the hunt for popcorn or even why the mysterious aliens also want to acquire the popcorn, it is key to the narrative of the game. There are 4 levels in the game, each with their own unique twist. The first level starts with astronaut climbing a mountain trying to catch the spawning popcorn. But watch out, the alien is there too. In the second level, the player must go deep beneath the moon’s surface to find a shovel. In the third level, the astronaut gets to fly around with a jet pack! The moon is their oyster, the player can go in any direction they wish! All three levels lead up to the FINAL LEVEL! In an all-out boss battle the astronaut must defeat the alien with its laser gun. 

Mechanics: 

In most of the levels, the astronaut can only go left and right and can jump. The astronaut can interact with the signs and the collision box platforms beneath the earth. Once the astronaut collides with the fuel tank, the player can move in any direction using the any of the arrow keys or WASD keys. To interact with the signs, all the player has to do is collide their astronaut with the sign sprite. 

Aesthetics: 

We chose a simple pixelated aesthetic to match the simplicity of our game. The astronaut also has some simple animation so that it appears to be moving even while idle. It also changes direction when the arrow key changes. The music was found on freesound.org under ‘space music’. The techno vibes enriched the astronautical experience.  

Joys and struggles: 

Our group encountered the infamous Github merge error at the end of our project. We had to copy and paste a lot of an old version of our project into the newest verison. While this wasn’t difficult, it did require a lot of time that we weren’t anticipating on. Figuring out how to make the dialog work in all the scenes was tricky, but after figuring out that there can only be 1 event system in the game it was a simple fix. We included all the text boxes and images needed in the main menu scene instead of in each individual scene. Triggers activated the inactive text boxes and images for when we needed them.

Division of the labor: 

We tried to divide up the work as best as possible. Cade designed Levels 1-3 and Olivia designed the Start Menu and the Final Level. There was a lot of tilemap work need in level 2 when the astronaut goes underground. This underground maze was completely designed by Cade as well as the popcorn particle systems. Any dialog found throughout the game was made and written by Olivia.
